  // in this component, we have no props, so our UI is just a function of state
  // so .. we have some fixed html being generated, and then lots of bits of state logic to generate the html that shows the state we're in.
  // ideally we'd like to use a switch statement for the status being 'halt' or 'lost' or 'won', but as it can only ever be one value at any given time,
  // its ok to just stack up the if's as per below.
  // remember that you can't do an actual "if" in JSX, but you can either do an if like this:
  // {check-this-condition && (render-this-html-if-true) }
  // or you can do an if/else using a ternary like this:
  // {check-this-condition ? (render-this-html-if-true) : (render-this-html-if-false) }
  // if you really really (really) want to do a switch, or more complex logic checking, then you can do an IIFE - but they are best avoided to be honest
  // I have put a dummy one in the html for you to see, but the bracket combinations aren't exactly pleasant !
  // {(() => { 
  //   whatever code you want here, literally any JS you like
  //   if your code is going to generate some html, it just has to return () it and it will be added to the page
